# LAND-REGISTRY-DAPP-

🔗 Land Registry DApp 

The Land Registry DApp is a blockchain-based decentralized application designed to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof solution for land ownership management. Built using Solidity, Ethereum, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project eliminates the risks of fraud, corruption, and inefficiency in traditional land registry systems.


🔹 Key Features :

✅ Smart Contract-Based      Ownership: Stores and verifies land records on the Ethereum blockchain.

✅ Decentralized & Secure:   Eliminates centralized control, preventing fraud and unauthorized modifications.

✅ Ownership Transfer:     Enables secure and transparent transfer of property ownership through smart contracts.

✅ User Authentication:    Only verified users can register and manage land assets.

✅ Web3.js Integration:     Enables seamless interaction between the frontend and the Ethereum network.

✅ Tamper-Proof Records:    Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered.


🔹 Technologies Used :

🔹 Solidity – Smart contract development

🔹 Ethereum Blockchain – Secure and decentralized ledger

🔹 Web3.js – Communication between frontend and blockchain

🔹 HTML, CSS, JavaScript – User interface and experience design


🔹 How It Works :

1️⃣ User Registration – Users register and authenticate through a secure login process.

2️⃣ Property Registration – New land records are added to the blockchain with verified details.

3️⃣ Ownership Transfer – Smart contracts execute secure ownership transfers upon validation.
